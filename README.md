# LC3 Tutor Repository

- The root folder contains scripts used to run the different user programs. Use the PennSim command "script <script name>.txt" to run the user program.
- The folder "user" contains the user program files. You can go in this folder and run the programs directly or use the scripts in the root folder.
- The folder "lc3os" contains the operating systems. Each OS may have a different MPR setting.
- The folder "imageGenerator" contains a webpage that uses Javascript to generate LC3 code for images you create. Use this to create images to be displayed on the PennSim graphics display.
